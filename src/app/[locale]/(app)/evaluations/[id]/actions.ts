/**
 * Server-side-only evaluation lifecycle transition (CLAUDE.md §4-A: "State
 * transitions are server-side only — never trust client-sent state"). The
 * caller never supplies the current or target state — this reads the
 * TRUE current state itself and advances exactly one step, using
 * src/lib/vpra.ts's already-unit-tested `canAdvanceEvaluationState`/
 * `transitionEvaluationState` (the single source of truth for the §4-A
 * table), never a client-provided value.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT re-implement org-scoping or row ownership here —
 * the SELECT/UPDATE both go through the caller's own RLS-respecting
 * client, so `evaluations`' existing RLS policies (20260718000001) remain
 * the actual authorization boundary for "can this caller touch this row at
 * all." This action only adds the state-machine check on top: "given that
 * the row IS visible/writable to them, does any of their roles hold an
 * actionable (prepare/recommend/approve) level at the row's CURRENT state."
 *
 * Known, deliberate limitation (matches 20260718000001's own documented
 * follow-up): `evaluations`' RLS today only grants non-self write access
 * at `check_vpra('evaluation','approve',...)` — i.e. `hr_admin` — because
 * `employee` and `supervisor` share the identical flat `'prepare'` grant
 * and RLS can't yet tell them apart without a supervisor-relationship
 * column. In practice today this means: an employee CAN submit their own
 * draft (self-row RLS), and hr_admin CAN perform the final
 * committee_reviewed -> approved transition (approve-level RLS) — but a
 * real supervisor/manager/committee member will have their UPDATE
 * silently affect 0 rows (reported here as "forbidden") until that
 * relationship mechanism exists, even though src/lib/vpra.ts's own table
 * says their role SHOULD be able to advance the state at that point. This
 * action does not attempt to work around that gap (e.g. via the
 * service-role client) — fixing it belongs in the RLS layer, not by
 * re-deriving authorization here. `approved -> finalized` is correctly
 * unreachable through this action for every role: `vpra.ts` models it as
 * system-triggered (no role holds more than `'view'` there), so
 * `canAdvanceEvaluationState` already returns false for it.
