/**
 * Two columns: the form on one side, an illustrated panel on the other
 * (2026-08-24, following a reference layout the project owner sent).
 *
 * The brand lockup lives on the illustrated panel (2026-08-29, requested):
 * the logo already carries the university's name in both languages, so
 * repeating it as text beside the form said the same thing twice. What sits
 * under the logo now is what this system IS — برنامج إدارة الأداء — which the
 * logo cannot say.
 *
 * Two things in the original reference are deliberately NOT here, because they
 * would be controls that do nothing:
 *
 *  - "Continue with Google". No Google provider is configured for this
 *    project; sign-in is Supabase email/username + password.
 *  - "Get started, it's free" and a sign-up link. Accounts here are created by
 *    HR and sent as an invite (SECURITY_CHECKLIST 1.7 — signup disabled), so
 *    that slot says how to obtain an account instead of offering to create one.
